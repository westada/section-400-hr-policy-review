# Important Note

This is a test version of a new system (GitHub) that the West Ada School District is currently exploring to support the organization and management of Board Policies and Administrative Regulations (ARs) associated with the West Ada School District Board of Trustees.

This platform is in an experimental phase and intended for internal use only. As such, the content presented here does not represent official West Ada School District policy or procedure.

## Understanding Policy and ARs

There are two components to this site, Policies and Administrative Regulations.

**Policies** are set by the Board of Trustees.  They tend to be declarative, general, and strategic.  Policies are meant to address "what" the District is attempting to accomplish.  

**Administrative Regulations**, or ARs, are set by the Administration through the Superintendent.  They tend to be imperative, specific, and tactical.  ARs are meant to address "how" the District accomplishes the "what". 

Every Policy is voted on by the Board of Trustees in open session, typically after a three-reading process.  These may be commented on by the public and remain in force until and unless supersded by statute or rescinded by the Board (again, following a three-reading process in open session.)

Every AR is written by the Administration and can change at any time.  However, any changes in Administrtative Regulation must be presented to the Board in open session (typically on the "consent agenda") allowing for oversight.

The goal with this approach is to maintain the utlimate authority with the People through their elected representatives, while still allowing the district professionals to manage the day-to-day operations with flexibility and responsiveness to on-the-ground conditions.

## Section 400 Rework

Section 400 relates to Staff (ie, Human Resources).  Historically, many operational HR details were maintained in policy which proved to be cumbersome, difficult to understand, and inflexible.  In an effort to improve this situation, the Policy Review Committee undertook an effort starting approximately 18 months ago to enhance both Policies and ARs using the approach above.  This process has since been completed with Section 100, 200 and 300; Section 400 is simply next in line.   

Generally, the Policy Review Committee undertakes policy changes on-at-a-time.  However, the complexity and interdependency of Section 400 made this effectively impossible.  As a result, we decided to address Section 400 in total, with the goal of presenting all the changes in one large update.  

This website represents these proposed changes as they are expected to be presented to the Board for a formal vote.  They will be updated on this site in real-time, and are expected to go through multiple readings (at least three but potentially more) and work sessions.  The goal is to have Section 400 completed and approved prior to July 1 so that District personnel have an opportunity to review and adjust before the start of the 2025-2026 school year.
