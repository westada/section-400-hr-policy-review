# Important Note

This is a test version of a new system (GitHub) that the West Ada School District is currently exploring to support the organization and management of Board Policies and Administrative Regulations (ARs) associated with the West Ada School District Board of Trustees.

This platform is in an experimental phase and intended for internal use only. As such, the content presented here does not represent official West Ada School District policy or procedure.

## Understanding Policy and ARs

There are two components to this site, Policies and Administrative Regulations.

**Policies** are set by the Board of Trustees, and are designed to set the strategy for a particular objective.  They tend to be short, imperative, and more general.

**Administrative Regulations**, or ARs, are set by the District Administration through the Superintendent.  ARs are designed to set the tactics for how to achieve the policy objective.  They tend to be long, operational, and more specific.  

Every Policy is voted on by the Board of Trustees in open session, typically after a three-reading process.  These may be commented on by the public, and remain in force until and unless supersded by statute or rescinded by the Board (again, following a three-reading process in open session.)

Every AR is written by the Administration and can change at any time.  However, any changes in Administrtative Regulation must be presented to the Board in open session (typically on the "consent agenda".) 

The goal with this approach is to maintain the utlimate authority for the District with the People through their elected representatives, while still allowing the district professionals to manage the day-to-day operations with  flexibility and responsiveness.

## Section 400 Rework

Section 400 relates to staff policies and ARs.  Historically, many operational details were maintained in policy which proved to be cumbersome, difficult to understand, and inflexible.  In an effort to improve this situation, the Policy Review Committee undertook an effort approximately 18 months ago to maintain strategic objectives in policy while moving operational details to ARs.

Generally, the Policy Review Committee undertakes policy changes atomically.  However, the complexity and interdependency of Section 400 made this very difficult to acheive.  As a result, we decided to address section 400 in total, with the goal of presenting all the changes in one large update.  This website represents these proposed changes as they would appear were they to be approved by the Board.
