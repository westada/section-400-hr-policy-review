The West Ada School Board plays an important role in shaping the direction of our schools. Made up of five elected trustees—each representing a specific area of our district—the board works together to set the policies that guide daily operations. Trustees don’t act alone, but instead make decisions as a group during public meetings. These individuals volunteer their time and serve four-year terms, helping ensure our schools are supported and our students succeed.
