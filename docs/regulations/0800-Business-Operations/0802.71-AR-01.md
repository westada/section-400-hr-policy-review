# Payroll Fees

## Child Support Withholding

The District will collect and retain $5.00 per collection in addition to the withholding order amount to reimburse administrative costs when ordered to withhold child support from an employee’s paycheck.

## Mailing Payroll Checks

With administrative approval, an employee may elect to have payroll checks mailed, rather than delivered to the place of employment. The District will deduct $2.00 per paycheck to offset administrative expenses. This fee does not apply to the regular mailing of summer payroll checks or the regular mailing of substitute teacher payroll checks.

## Payroll Garnishment Fee

When ordered by the courts to make a garnishment from an employee’s paycheck, the District will collect and retain $10.00 per collection in addition to the amount of garnishment specified, in order to reimburse District administrative costs.
