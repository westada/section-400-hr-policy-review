# Misuse of Leave

The District believes absences from work responsibilities interfere with the quality program the students expect and deserve. The District also realizes there are circumstances that will prevent an employee from being on the job. Absences from work responsibilities are covered by the leaves provided by state statute, Negotiated Agreement, and policy and should be used judiciously. Therefore, in the event an employee violates or misuses any Leave Policy or Negotiated Agreement, or misrepresents any statement or condition with respect to the use of the policies or articles, he/she may be subject to a reprimand or termination.

For certificated personnel abuse of leave may also result in an appropriate report to the Professional Standards Commission.
