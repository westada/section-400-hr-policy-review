This policy governs the use of District-owned physical property for displays, decorations, and visual content within classrooms and other school facilities, including both permanent and temporary materials. 
  
This policy applies specifically to the use of District-owned physical property and does not restrict private speech outside of that context.

The West Ada School District, on behalf of its employees, students, and parents, consistent with the Idaho Code, firmly believes the flag of the United States of America should be proudly displayed in every classroom of its schools.  West Ada also believes that all physical property of the District should encourage a positive learning environment, and the classroom arranged in such a manner to support the instructional goals and District-approved curriculum.  To foster these goals, the only other flags, or banners (including posters, signs, pictures or other digital or physical images) that may be flown, posted, or affixed to the physical property of the District will be content neutral and conducive to a positive learning environment.
