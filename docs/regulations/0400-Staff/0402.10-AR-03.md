## SUSPENSION AND DISMISSAL

Classified personnel may be suspended with or without pay for disciplinary reasons as determined by their immediate supervisor or building principal, with approval from the Chief Human Resources Officer.  Such suspension shall be in writing, setting forth the reason(s) for the suspension and informing them of their right to file a grievance following the procedures as outlined in Administrative Regulation 402.10-AR-07.
 
A classified employee’s immediate supervisor or principal may dismiss said employee, with approval from the Chief Human Resources Officer.  Such dismissal shall be in writing, setting forth the reason(s) for dismissal and informing the dismissed employee of his/her right to file a grievance with the appropriate supervisor, following the procedures outlined in Administrative Regulation 402.10-AR-07.

## REDUCTION IN CLASSIFIED STAFF

The Board of Trustees has the exclusive authority to determine the appropriate number of employees. A reduction of employees may occur as a result of, but not be limited to, changes in the education program, financial conditions or limitations of the district, staff realignment, changes in the size or demographics of the student population or at the discretion of the Board for other reasons relevant to school district operations.

The Board may consider performance evaluations, staff needs, date of hire, and other reasons deemed relevant by the Board in order to determine the order of dismissal if it reduces classified staff or discontinues an educational service and the staff who support it.
