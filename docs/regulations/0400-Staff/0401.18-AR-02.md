## Certified
  
Certified personnel currently under contract may apply to the District for reimbursement.  The District will pay up to $65.00 per credit for the tuition for courses taken for re-certification and/or for courses taken to fulfill a degree program. A maximum of $1,000.00 per certified personnel per year will be distributed. Scholarship reimbursement is provided for the cost of credits only, not books or fees.  Claims for reimbursement should be submitted as soon as the final grades are posted. Funds will be distributed on a first come first serve basis. To receive the reimbursement payment the personnel must provide copies of the class description, proof of successful completion, and receipts showing expenses incurred. June classes will be eligible for reimbursement during the next school year. When the budget for scholarship is exhausted, no additional funds will be paid for the remainder of the fiscal year.
