## WORKING HOURS

Working Hours for classified personnel will be based upon each individual employee's assignment.   Non-exempt classified personnel are required to use the school's time clock time management system to maintain an accurate and contemporaneous record of the employee's working hours.

The classified employee is responsible for properly clocking in and out of the school's time clock management system and is responsible for assuring that the records are accurate.   Falsification or inaccurate time entries can lead to employee discipline up to and including possible termination.

The District will comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Fair Labor and Standards Act (FLSA). To remain in compliance, supervisors must monitor work schedules to assure that no employee works in excess of normal scheduled hours except as provided for in policy.

## PROBATIONARY PERIOD

All new classified employees will be hired on a 180 workday probationary period.

A classified employee of the District may not file a grievance regarding their rate of salary or wage nor the decision to terminate an employee for cause during the initial 180 days of employment.
