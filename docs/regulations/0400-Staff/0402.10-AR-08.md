Working Hours for classified personnel will be based upon each individual's assignment.   Non-exempt classified personnel are required to use the District's time clock time management system to maintain an accurate and contemporaneous record of the personnel's working hours.

Classified personnel are responsible for properly clocking in and out of the District's time clock management system and is responsible for assuring that the records are accurate. Falsification or inaccurate time entries can lead to personnel discipline up to and including possible termination.

The District will comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Fair Labor and Standards Act (FLSA). To remain in compliance, supervisors and principals must monitor work schedules to assure that no personnel works in excess of normal scheduled hours except as authorized.
