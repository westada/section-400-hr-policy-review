title: 0403.76-AR-01 Fingerprint and Criminal Background Check
---

Applicants who are being considered for employment and/or receive an offer of employment must be fingerprinted and undergo background screening. Refusal of an applicant or personnel to be fingerprinted, failure to report for fingerprinting or failure to provide such information as is necessary to conduct a background check will be sufficient cause for disqualification for employment or termination from employment. 

Fingerprints will be submitted using the “LiveScan” process in the Human Resources Department and in accordance with applicable state, federal and local laws. 

A background check may include, but is not limited to, reference checks, employment history, criminal history, review of previous employer personnel files and public records. The district will comply will all applicable requirements of state and federal laws. 

If the fingerprinting or criminal background check discloses a previous criminal conviction, the Chief Human Resources Officer will conduct an individualized assessment, taking into account a number of factors in determining whether to disqualify the applicant and/or employee and rescind the offer of employment. Factors may include the safety and wellbeing of students, nature of the position, nature of the conviction, length of time since conviction and completion of any resulting incarceration or probation.
