The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave each year for specified family and medical reasons. An eligible employee is defined as an individual who:

- Has been employed by the District for at least twelve (12) months; and

- Has been employed for at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours of service during the twelve- month (12-month) period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave; and

- Is employed at a worksite where fifty (50) or more employees are employed by the District within seventy-five (75) miles of the worksite.

- A general notice regarding FMLA will be provided to all potentially eligible employees upon hire.

For the purpose of determining eligibility for FMLA, this District will calculate the “twelve-month (12-month) period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave” as a rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. FMLA runs concurrently with sick leave, personal leave, vacation or short term disability.

FMLA leave may be taken by an employee for any of the following reasons:

- To care for the employee’s child after birth or placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care;

- To provide care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent, who has a serious health condition; or

- For a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the employee’s job.

An employee must promptly advise the Human Resource Department, as soon as the employee becomes aware that he/she is, or will become, temporarily unable to work for any medical reason (pregnancy, personal or family serious health condition) for more than five (5) consecutive days. If the employee is unable to make this contact due to unforeseen circumstances, then it is the responsibility of the direct supervisor to make contact with Human Resources within five (5) days of becoming aware that the employee may need FML- Notification of eligibility must be given to the employee within five (5) days after the Human Resources Department becomes aware that the employee has the need for leave. In addition, intermittent leave or reduced scheduled hours leave may be requested by the employee when medically necessary due to a serious health condition.

- A medical certification must be received in Human Resources within fifteen (15) calendar days before the leave will be designated as FMLA; if the certification is not received within the fifteen (15) calendar days, the employee may give up their right to FMLA.

- A fitness-for-duty or return to work certification must be received, upon request, in order for the employee to be restored to employment showing that they can perform all functions of the job they were hired to perform before the end of the FMLA leave.

- In general, a fitness-for-duty certification may not be required for each absence taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. However, if the employer has a reasonable belief that the employee’s return to work presents a significant risk of harm to the employee or to others, the employer may require a fitness-for-duty certification up to once every thirty (30 days).

- The employee’s return to work may be delayed until the fitness-for-duty certification is provided. Human Resources may contact an employee’s health care provider to clarify or authenticate a fitness-for-duty certification but cannot delay the employee’s return to work while making that contact. Under no circumstances may the employee’s direct supervisor contact the employee’s health care provider.

- A return to work with restrictions does not restore the employee’s job even if they are working and doing light duty nor does light duty or work restrictions count as full employment. Light duty is an option to which both parties must agree. The District may deny light duty and or rescind light duty if there is a cause for concern. The FMLA entitlement is still in effect.

## Qualifying Exigency Leave Entitlements for Military Personnel

Qualifying exigencies may arise when the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent whose is a member of the Armed Forces (including the National Guard and Reserves) and who is on covered active duty or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty. For purposes of qualify exigency leave, an employee’s son or daughter on covered active duty refers to a child of any age. Please see Appendix C and D for a list of qualify exigency categories.

## Effect on Pay and Benefits:

FMLA leave is unpaid leave; however, the employee must take any accrued paid vacation days, personal days or sick leave to which he/she is entitled. Use of sick leave must comply with District Policy 402.4- For example, if he/she has accrued two weeks of paid vacation leave, his/her first two weeks of FMLA will also count as paid vacation leave and he/she will receive his/her accrued vacation pay for that period.

If the employee takes a leave of absence which he/she or the District designates as “FMLA”, his/her medical benefits will continue on the same terms and conditions as if he/she were actively at work. The District will continue to pay its share of the benefits. The employee will continue to pay his/her share of either medical or voluntary benefits. The District will provide any necessary notice of termination of such insurance coverage due to the employee’s failure to pay his/her portion of the premium or the employee’s request for termination of coverage. Such notice will be provided at least fifteen (15) days prior to the termination of coverage.

The West Ada School District is in compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act (Appendix A, B, C and D) and will follow the guidelines, rules and regulations.
