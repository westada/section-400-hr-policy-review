## Definitions

For the purpose of administrating Policy 0403.54, the following defintions apply:

**Relative**: father, mother, husband, wife, son, daughter, sister, brother, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, mother-in-law, father-in- law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law.

**Supervise**: the authority to recommend or approve the relative’s appointment, promotion, salary, evaluation, termination, or other similar personnel action.

## Process

To avoid a conflict of interest, at no time shall any administrator/supervisor be responsible for the supervision and/or evaluation of any employee directly related to him/her. No District employee shall directly supervise another employee who is a relative when the salary, wages, pay, or compensation of the relative will be paid from public funds. The District employee shall not evaluate the relative’s job performance or recommend salary increases for the relative.

Current employees of the District working at the same site, but not in a supervisory and/or evaluative relationship, shall be allowed to continue until such a relationship changes.

Persons currently employed by the District prior to the inception of such relationship may be transferred to another building or placed under different supervision, if necessary, to eliminate potential conflicts of interest.
