## Definitions

To minimize the risk of conflicts of interest and promote fairness, the District maintains the following expectations with respect to nepotism and romance in the workplace.

**Relative**: father, mother, husband, wife, child, sister, brother, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, mother-in-law, father-in- law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, grandparent, great-grandparent, cousin.

**Supervise**: the authority to recommend or approve the relative’s appointment, promotion, salary, evaluation, termination, or other similar personnel action.

## Process

No principal, supervisor or personnel shall be responsible for the supervision and/or evaluation of any personnel directly related to them or whom directly involved in a romantic or dating relationship. No personnel shall directly supervise another personnel who is a relative, or are in a relationship with, and have direct responsibility over their salary, wages, pay, or compensation. Personnel shall not evaluate the relative’s job performance or recommend salary increases for the relative or romantic relationship.

Current personnel working at the same site, but not in a supervisory and/or evaluative relationship, shall be allowed to continue until such a relationship changes.

Personnel currently employed by the District prior to the inception of such relationship may be transferred to another building or placed under different supervision, if necessary, to eliminate potential conflicts of interest.
