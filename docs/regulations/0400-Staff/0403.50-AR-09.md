The following procedures shall be used to appeal the determination of the neutral nature of a display.     

## Site Level Review

To avoid classroom disruption, the display in question will remain in place during the site level review.    

In such instances, the following procedures shall apply: 

1. In an informal meeting, the building principal or designee, along with the affected employee shall discuss the specific concerns observed in the classroom display. 
2. If an agreement is reached about the scope of the display’s use in that building, the building principal shall clearly state, in writing to the employee, the terms of the agreement.  
3. If an agreement is not reached, a site level appeal may be initiated by the employee within** 5 operational days** of being notified of the concern.  
The appeal shall be conducted as follows: 
    - The principal shall bring the visual to the school leadership team within 5 operational days of receiving the appeal.   
    - The team must come to a conclusion by a vote of 50% +1 to determine one of the actions listed below.  If a simple majority is not initially determined the committee with eliminate the option receiving the fewest votes and revote until a simple majority is determined.   
    - The teacher may choose to provide a written rationale for the display.. 
The options for the team to consider are as follows:  
    - The visual is in alignment with policy 403.5

    - The visual needs to be recreated, similar in nature to maintain neutrality.   
4. The administrator must submit rationale for the committees decision in writing to both the complainant and the teacher **within 5 operational days **of the decision.  
5. If either the teacher or the complainant wishes to further challenge the use and placement of the visual, then the matter will be referred to Dr. Shana Hawkins to convene the District Visual Review Committee.

The request must include: 

- Documentation of a completed Site Level Review,

**Considerations:**
The committee shall: 

- Research the visual display, if accessible, to identify whether it is widely accepted by educational professionals, scholars, or subject matter experts.  
- Review the visual display to ensure it complies with all applicable district policies and adheres to relevant state laws and educational guidelines.  
- Consider both the strengths and weaknesses of the visual display, including any concerns raised by the complainant, and evaluate its overall appropriateness based on its intended use and relevance within the educational program. 
- Review the content for neutrality using the following guiding statements:
    - Is the subject of intense public argument, disagreement, or disapproval.
    - Includes political messages, such as displays of partisan political affiliation or advocacy for specific political candidates or parties.

    - Incites controversy, debate, or divisiveness within the school community.   
- Voting by the Reconsideration Committee shall take place during the meeting. Each member of the Reconsideration Committee shall have one (1) vote. 
- If after an initial vote, a majority of the committee (50%+1) has not reached an agreement on one of the above-referenced resolutions, a re-vote will be taken between the two resolution options that received the highest number of votes in the first vote. If there are not two clear resolution options that have received the highest number of votes, a re-vote will take place at the discretion of the District Superintendent or Designee, until there is a majority of votes. The decision will be made within the scope of the complaint and will include one of the following: 
    - The visual is in alignment with policy 403.5
    - The visual is not in alignment with 403.5
    - The visual needs to be recreated, similar in nature to maintain neutrality.

- If the visual proposed for District reconsideration is the subject of a current District Administrative Review or a Site Level Review, the formal reconsideration shall be stayed until the District Administrative Review or Site Level Review has concluded.  

**Resolution**
The Director of Accountability and Support shall prepare a written  report detailing committees activities, considerations, and the final decision  **within ten (10) operational days** of the decision being made. A draft of the report shall be provided to the Superintendent or designee prior to being finalized and issued. A dissenting report may also be filed and distributed. 

Once finalized and released, the written report shall be retained by the District Director of Accountability and Support with copies forwarded to the Superintendent, the Director of Curriculum and Instruction, and the Chief Academic Officer. A dissenting report may also be filed. 

The Director of Accountability and Support will notify the complainant of the decision and will provide the complainant with a copy of the written report of the committee. Committee members will remain anonymous. 

The decision of the Reconsideration Committee is binding for all district schools. 

- Both the employee and the complainant reserve the right to appeal the District Reconsideration Committee’s final decision to the Superintendent. The Superintendent will determine whether the appeal merits further review or referral to the Board of Trustees. The Board's decision, if made, shall be final and binding across the District. 
- A written appeal of the committee's decision must be filed within five (5) operational days of communication of the decision to the Clerk of the Board.

The Superintendent may refer the appeal to the Board of Trustees.  

- The Board shall, at its discretion, determine if it is going to overturn or uphold the committee's resolution as a final decision. 

It shall be the responsibility of the Director of Support and Accountability to collect and maintain all District records associated with the activities detailed in this policy.  

Any irregularities in process/protocol may be addressed by the Superintendent or designee. 

For the purposes of this administrative regulation, "operational days" are defined as days when the employee involved in the review process is actively working under contract. This means that any review-related tasks cannot be conducted during school holidays, scheduled breaks, or the summer months when the employee is not under contract. As a result, review activities may be paused during these non-operational periods, and the associated timelines will be adjusted as needed to allow for the completion of the processes outlined in this regulation. 

All proceedings will be conducted with a commitment to confidentiality and non-retaliation. Committee members will remain anonymous, and no retaliatory action shall be taken against any participant in the review process, in accordance with District policy and Idaho law.
