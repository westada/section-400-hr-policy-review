EXTENDED SICK LEAVE

In all cases, if absence from work exceeds a period of ten (10) consecutive working days, the employee must furnish to the Human Resources Department a doctor’s certification that the employee's medical condition or complications are such that the employee is unable to carry on his/her duties satisfactorily. When an employee returns to work from an absence of ten (10) or more consecutive days, a medical release from the employee’s health care provider is required and must be submitted to Human Resources prior to the commencement of work. If the employee’s medical release indicates work restrictions, Human Resources will engage in the interactive process to determine what reasonable accommodation, if any, will permit the employee to return to work in accordance with the ADA. 

If an employee fails to provide doctor’s certification and/or medical release within fifteen (15) calendar days of being requested, the request for leave may be denied or delayed until sufficient certification is provided.

(Certified Leaves are described in the Negotiated Agreement)
