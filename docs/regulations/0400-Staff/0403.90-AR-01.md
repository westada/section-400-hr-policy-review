EXTENDED SICK LEAVE

In all cases, if absence from work exceeds a period of ten (10) consecutive working days, personnel must furnish to the Human Resources Department medical certification that the individual's medical condition or complications are such that the individual is unable to carry on their duties satisfactorily. When an employee returns to work from an absence of ten (10) or more consecutive days, a medical release from the individualâ€™s health care provider is required and must be submitted to the Human Resources Department prior to the commencement of work. If the personnel's medical release indicates work restrictions, Human Resources will engage in the interactive process to determine what reasonable accommodation, if any, will permit the personnel to return to work in accordance with the ADA. 

If personnel fails to provide medical certification and/or return to work certification within fifteen (15) calendar days of being requested, the request for leave may be denied or delayed until sufficient certification is provided.
