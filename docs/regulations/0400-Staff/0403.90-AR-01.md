EXTENDED SICK LEAVE

In all cases, if absence from work exceeds a period of ten (10) consecutive working days, the certified and administrative employees must furnish to the Human Resources Director a doctor’s certification that medical complications are such that the employee is unable to carry on his/her duties satisfactorily. When an employee returns to work from an absence of ten (10) consecutive days, a medical release from the employee’s health care provider must be submitted to Human Resources. The release should include any accommodations that are necessary for the employee to resume work.

(Certified Leaves are described in the Master Contract)
