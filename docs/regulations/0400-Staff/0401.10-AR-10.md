SECURING A SUBSTITUTE

Teachers are to report the need for a substitute prior to the commencement of the work day as early as possible.  For planned absences, teachers are to report the need for a substitute with as much advanced notice as possible.

No teacher is to call a substitute and pay for such services from personal funds.
