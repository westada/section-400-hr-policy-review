Personnel are cautioned to take special care with personal property, as the District does not assume liability for lost, stolen or damaged personal items. Unless specifically authorized by a Board-adopted written Policy, the District is not responsible for personal property such as books, tools, equipment, personal technology, clothing, or other such personal items which employees may bring to or use upon District premises. Personal items that are medical necessary (e.g. prescription eye wear, hearing aids) that are damaged may be subject to reimbursement. 

Personnel shall not be required to use personal tools or equipment to perform job responsibilities except with Chief Human Resources Officer authorization.
