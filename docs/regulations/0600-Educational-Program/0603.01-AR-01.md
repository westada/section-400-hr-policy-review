**Initial Placement of Students When Enrolling**

The school counselor will place the entering student in the appropriate courses and/or grade level with consideration to:


Available documentation – transcripts, report card, test scores, work samples, etc.
The student/parent/guardian’s assessment of his/her knowledge and abilities as well as courses believed to be
successfully completed
Instructional materials with which the student has had experience
The student’s age

Appeals may be made to the Director of Curriculum & Instruction. The director’s decision is final.

**Acceleration**

Parents/guardians, teachers, or administrators may refer students in kindergarten for early entry into first (1st) grade or for grade

acceleration in grades one through eight (1-8) by following these procedures:


Submit either the Application for Early Entry into 1st Grade or the Application for Grade Acceleration 1st-8th Grades , as
appropriate, to building administration for a review of the proposed change of placement. These forms can be found in the
Curriculum SharePoint site or by contacting the Gifted and Talented Coordinator.
Building administration or designee will contact the Gifted and Talented Coordinator to secure access to the West Ada
Grade Acceleration document and Iowa Acceleration Scale (IAS) as well as any necessary advisement to guide the
Multidisciplinary Team decision-making process.
Building Administration or designee will schedule discussion of the proposed acceleration with the MTSS Team.
MTSS Team determines the process for the collection of data, completion of the IAS, entry of data into Enrich, and
scheduling and facilitation of future MTSS meetings as required. (team members present should include;
Administrator, School Psychologist, Parents/Guardians, GT representative, Counselor, current teacher, and teacher
representing grade level of proposed acceleration).
Upon completion of the IAS following the data collection procedures outlined in the WA Grade Acceleration
document and review by the MTSS team a determination is made by the MTSS Team on the proposed student
acceleration.
If there is disagreement among team members determining whether to accelerate or remain in current grade the
building administrator makes the final determination based on available data collected by the MTSS team.
If the student is not accelerated to the next grade level, the MTSS team should seek alternative methods of meeting
the referred student’s needs.

**Retention**

The West Ada School District recognizes the current research on grade retention which clearly indicates retention leads to significantly

higher levels of negative impacts than positive impacts. Therefore, referral for retention is not the practice followed by West Ada staff.

Parents/Guardians may refer their student(s) for retention by following these procedures:


Parent communicates the desire to have their student retained to school administration.
School administration schedules discussion of the proposed retention with the school MTSS Team.
MTSS Team determines the process for the collection of data, entry of data into Enrich, and scheduling and facilitation
of future MTSS meetings as required. (team members present should include; Administrator, School Psychologist,
Parents/Guardians, Counselor, current teacher.
Upon the completion of pertinent data and review by the MTSS team, a determination is made by the MTSS Team on
the proposed student retention.

If there is disagreement among team members determining whether the student should be retained, a notice will be
placed in the student’s cumulative file that the retention was a parent's decision and not the recommendation of the
school.
