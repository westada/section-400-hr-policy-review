**Participation**:

Students may participate in their home school's commencement ceremonies, provided they have no significant unresolved disciplinary matters. If this condition is not met, students must submit a written request to the Superintendent or designee at least 10 days before the ceremony.

Early graduates may join the annual commencement ceremony by notifying their building administrator and assigned school counselor in writing no later than 30 days before the event.

Students wishing to participate in commencement at a different school site may request an exception from the Superintendent or designee in writing, at least 30 days before the ceremony.

Part-time students (as defined by Policy 500.1) may request an exception to participate in their home school's commencement ceremony by completing the appropriate form.

Students who do not meet the above criteria or wish to participate in a commencement ceremony other than their home school may request an exception through a process overseen by the Superintendent or designee. Appeals will be heard by the Board of Trustees.
