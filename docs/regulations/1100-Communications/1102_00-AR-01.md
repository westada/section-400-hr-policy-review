These are the administrative procedures for covering District media relations.

The District’s Chief Communications Officer is the point person for media requests. All such requests will be directed
to the District’s Chief Communications Officer in order to coordinate the response.

Employees are to direct all school-related media inquiries to the principal and the District’s communications team.

The District recognizes that the nature of some positions require responses to media requests and interviews. In
coordination with the Chief Communications Officer and the principal, employees such as coaches, activity and
athletic directors, and supervisors shall respond to such requests for information in a clear and concise manner.

If an employee engages in media communications of any nature, whether personal or professional, clarity must be
given as to whether the individual is speaking as West Ada School District official or as a private citizen. However,
prior to responding to a media inquiry or initiating a communication directly to media contacts as a school district
official, employees must acquire authorization from the Superintendent or Chief Communications Officer.

As stated in policy, in coordination with the District’s Chief Communications Officer, the principal of each building
may be authorized to release crisis communications. Any person other than the principal must have the principal’s
authorization to release such information.
