These are the administrative procedures for district- and school-based social media.

Each schoolâ€™s brand ambassador is responsible for content shared across school-based social media accounts and adhering to policy and other best practices. Social media and best practice training will be provided to school media coordinators.

Student photos, names, grade levels, academic awards, and information regarding school-sponsored activities, organizations, and athletics may be shared on social media accounts. Any parent/guardian who has not completed the opt-out form therefore consents to the posting of such information.
