The administration of each school is charged with decisions concerning the discipline of any student, including, but
not limited to ensuring the student is afforded all due process at the building level as provided for in Idaho Code, and
providing all evidence to a District Discipline and Attendance Committee, where applicable.

Where all facts and evidence have been presented to the District Discipline and Attendance Committee, and
provided that a fair and just decision has been made according to the policies of the District, parents/legal
guardians/adult students may request, in writing, an appeal of the decision to the Board of Trustees within five (5)
school days of the decision.

If parents/legal guardians/adult students request an appeal to the Board of Trustees, a hearing will be scheduled and
held within the next five (5) school days following the receipt of the written request. If the Board of Trustees, in
review of the facts and evidence, reaches a decision that differs from the recommendation of the District Discipline
and Attendance Committee through the appeal process, this difference shall be justified only by:


1. Disclosure of new facts or evidence concerning the matter.
2. Decision of the Board of Trustees that the rules or regulations concerning the matter are not equitable and,
thus, should be changed.
3. Decision of the Board of Trustees that the welfare of all concerned would be better served by different action.

The Decision of the Board shall be reduced to writing and a copy provided to the parent/legal guardian/adult
student.
