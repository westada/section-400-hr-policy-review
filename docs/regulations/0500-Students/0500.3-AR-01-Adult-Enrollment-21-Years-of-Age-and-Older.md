A person aged twenty-one (21) or greater may be allowed to enroll as a student in the District to complete their
credits in order to obtain a high school diploma. Such shall be done through the following procedure:

1. The individual must contact the District's Chief Academic Officer regarding possible enrollment.

2. If enrollment is permitted, a Student Enrollment Plan must be developed to allow the student to attend courses
as a Rebound School student, but all courses will be taken through Virtual School House or some other virtual
educational model.

3, The Chief Academic Officer and Chief Operations Officer will determine the tuition costs, including any needed
tuition assistance through the West Ada Education Foundation or other partnering organizations.

A. The Student Enrollment Plan shall be developed by:

```
1. The returning adult student seeking to return
2. A counselor at Rebound
3. An administrator from Rebound
4. A District administrator in the Academic Department who is familiar with the applicable graduation
requirements.
```
B. This plan must address, at minimum:

```
1. The course work that the returning student needs to complete for graduation.
2. A schedule for the returning student for course completion.
3. Completion of any state-mandated course work and/or assessments that the returning adult student will be
required to complete for graduation.
4. The sums of tuition and the timing and manner in which the tuition payments will be made.
```
Prior to the development of the Student Enrollment Plan it shall be the responsibility of the returning adult student
to obtain verified copies of prior academic records, including but not limited to all courses attempted, grades and
credits earned.

3. Credits from an appropriately accredited institution other than the West Ada School District may be transferred
to West Ada, upon the approval of the Superintendent or designee, so long as:

```
1. There are no additional costs to the West Ada School District.
2. The institution is accredited by and accrediting body recognized by the state board of education (currently
Cognia).
3. The requested course meets the course equivalency requirements as determined by the District's
Superintendent or designee.
```
4. The student shall not be permitted to attend courses at any of the District's traditional in-person high school
sites. The Student Enrollment Plan shall address the returning adult student's completion of needed credits via
virtual programs.

5. In very limited exceptions, a returning adult student may be permitted to enroll in an IDLA class through the
District. Special enrollment arrangements would have to take place for this to occur and the returning adult student
would have to address any possible costs with both the District and IDLA.

Each returning adult student Enrollment Plan will be reduced to writing and signed off on by the adult student and a
District Administrator in the Academic Department who is familiar with the applicable graduation requirements.

If the plan requires more than one year of coursework and/or if the student was unable to complete the plan within a
school year, a meeting will be held to review the student's progress and address whether the student will be
permitted to continue enrollment, if the plan needs revision or if continued enrollment will be denied.

Should the returning adult student not make appropriate progress toward obtaining credits for graduation, the
District may choose to discontinue the Student  Enrollment Plan and deny to returning adult student the ability to
continue the process of earning credits toward graduation.

Though the returning adult student will be classified as a Rebound School student, the diploma issued to the
returning adult student shall be a general West Ada School District diploma, not specific for any of the District's
individual high schools.
