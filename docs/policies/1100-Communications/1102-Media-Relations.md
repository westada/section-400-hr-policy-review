 Media Relations

To accomplish communications goals within the community, the District will provide professional, proactive, and structured contact with our partners in the news media.

All official West Ada School District press releases, including those for individual schools, will be initiated and distributed by the Chief Communications Officer in coordination with the Superintendent.

Media inquiries to a school building including request for comment, interviews, request for data or information, and formal public records requests per Idaho law shall be referred to the District’s communications team.

The principal of each building may be authorized to release crisis communications in coordination with and after approval by the District’s Chief Communications Officer.

Nothing in policy restricts an employee from appropriately speaking as a private citizen, so long as it is made clear that the individual is speaking as a private citizen and is not representing the District in an official capacity.

A list of procedures for handling media requests will be provided by the District’s communications team.
