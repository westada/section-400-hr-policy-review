 School-Based Communications

School-based communications are important in keeping the community informed of the District’s operations and programs. The school building is the most important communication source, and the Superintendent and the communications team will provide all necessary support to provide effective communication to that school’s students, parents/guardians, and staff.

The main components of school communications will include, but are not limited to, the school’s website, newsletter, and social media. Email, text messages, and voice calls will also be utilized by the District and school buildings to support communications efforts. For time-sensitive and highly important information, multiple channels will be used to ensure wide dissemination.

These building level communications efforts will be led by the principal and/or a designee.

Procedures for administering school-based communications will be provided by the District’s communications team, which will focus on maintaining updated information on school communication mediums. The communications team will assist schools in fulfilling the requirements of this policy.
