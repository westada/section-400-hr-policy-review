Journalistic experiences in a school setting are calculated to develop the skills and understanding which equip a student for future responsibilities of the free press in our country. The Board strongly supports the development of these skills in our students and shall provide all appropriate resources to support school publications accordingly..

A school publication is unique and different from a commercial publication in the following ways:


- It is an instructive tool and a means of student self-expression;

- It is read not just by the intended audience of fellow students, but by parents and community members as well;

- It is largely supported by tax funds;

- It is an influence on the public perception of the District in its entirety since, rightly or wrongly, its content is read by many not simply as expressions of individual students, but as expressions representative of the entire student body as approved by the administration.

Freedom of expression goes hand-in-hand with responsibility for the published statement.

Expression is prohibited when the material:


- Is obscene;

- Is libelous;

- Creates an immediate danger or disruption to the school;

- Advertises or promotes any product or service not permitted for minors by law;

- Encourages students to commit illegal acts, violate school regulations, or substantially disrupts the orderly operation of school or school activities;

- Expresses or advocates sexual, racial or religious harassment, violence or prejudice;

- Does not meet journalistic standards established for publications.

A list of procedures for administering school-based communications will be provided by the Districtâ€™s communications team. The communications team will assist schools in fulfilling the requirements of this policy.
