# Policy 1100: Vision, Goals and Policy

The communications goal of the Board and the Superintendent of schools is to keep the community informed of the programs and operations of the District. The District aims to be a trusted partner in the community. Our communications efforts will demonstrate that the District is inclusive in decision-making, transparent, and responsive.

To meet these goals, it is important to proactively engage the diversity of constituencies that comprise the greater West Ada community. The District will use multiple channels of communication to engage students, families, staff, patrons, and other community and state leaders. The communications team will regularly assess the effectiveness of its communications efforts. When necessary, the communications team will make modifications to the methods of communication to reflect new technologies and communications practices.

The Superintendent and Chief Communications Officer will be responsible for administrating a continuous program of communications within the community.
