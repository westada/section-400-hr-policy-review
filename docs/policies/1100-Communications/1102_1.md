 Public Records Requests, Data Requests

The intent of the Idaho Public Records Law (Idaho Code §§ 74-101 through 74-126) is to ensure all non-exempt records maintained by state and local government entities are available for public access.

Ensuring transparency and trust in government is important to the West Ada School District. Properly fulfilling the goals of Idaho’s public records laws supports the goal of transparency.

Any employee in receipt of a public records request must forward such to the Clerk of the Board. The Clerk of the Board will appropriately respond to the petitioner.

The District’s communications team will provide a list of procedures for a formalized and structured process for handling public records requests and data requests.
