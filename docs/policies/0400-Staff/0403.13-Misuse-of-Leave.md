The board of trustees of West Ada School District believes that absences from work responsibilities interfere with the quality program the students expect and deserve. The board also realizes there are circumstances that will prevent an employee from being on the job. Absences from work responsibilities are covered by the leaves provided by state statute, master contract and policy and should be used judiciously. Therefore, in the event an employee violates or misuses any leave policy or master contract article, or misrepresents any statement or condition with respect to the use of the policies or articles, he/she may be subject to a reprimand or termination.
