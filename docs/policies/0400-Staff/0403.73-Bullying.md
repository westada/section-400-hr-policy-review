# 0403.73 Bullying

The Board of Trustees is committed to maintaining a work environment that protects and promotes dignity, individual worth, and mutual respect for each individual and is free from bullying. Each district employee deserves the opportunity to participate or work in a safe, supportive atmosphere that promotes equal opportunities, free from all forms of discrimination and conduct that can be considered as bullying, coercive or disruptive.

It shall be a violation of this policy for any District employee to bully another employee or individual through any means, including technology, while on any district property or at any District sponsored activity, regardless of location.

## DEFINITION:

Bullying is repeated aggressive behavior or frightening of others with an apparent intent to dominate. Bullying may include, but not be limited to physical (hitting, pushing or attacks on property); verbal (name-calling, obscene gestures, malicious teasing, or cyber bullying); or indirect attacks (anonymous hurtful notes, or spreading false rumors). Bullying often occurs without apparent provocation. Bullying is not playful teasing between relatively equal individuals.

Reporting, investigation, and discipline of bullying shall be the same as Policy Code No. 403.71, Harassment.
