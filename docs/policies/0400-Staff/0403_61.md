West Ada School District will make the Hepatitis B vaccine available for employees who are at risk of contracting the disease by:

- Accidentally being exposed to blood or blood products;

- Working closely with developmentally delayed students who are institutionalized or live in group homes/shelters; or

- Being bitten by students/clients they work with.

District nursing staff will determine, on a yearly basis, or as needed, those employees who meet the above criteria and will provide information on vaccinations. It is the responsibility of identified employees to arrange and receive the vaccinations as directed. Employees who feel they are at a significant risk need to contact the school nurse in their school for an assessment of risk. In the event that an unvaccinated employee has a risk of exposure while at work, the employee will be offered post-incidence vaccination.
