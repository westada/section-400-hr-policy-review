# 0401.60 

The work day for all certified staff shall be eight (8) hours, excluding any voluntary or extra paid duties such as leadership premium assignments, supplemental contract assignments or other extracurricular duties for which they are compensated. Certified staff who accept extra duty assignments are required to spend the necessary time it takes to perform such duties as outlined in the job description or as assigned by supervisors of the activity.

District employees are encouraged to participate, if possible, in as many voluntary activities that occur during non- workday hours if directly related to their students, such as back to school night and other all-school activities. At the discretion of the principal, the work day schedule can be flexible during the week of an all-school event.

Principals will make every effort to provide a 30-minute duty free lunch to all certified staff. They will also make every effort to assign any or all duties equitably. Certified staff may have the option to be paid an hourly wage for working as a noon duty aide.

Principals will schedule the preparatory period for teachers appropriate to the grade level in which the teacher works. This includes making every effort to provide adequate lunch and preparatory periods for special education teachers. Staff is encouraged to notify the building principal if they have concerns about their scheduled preparatory time.

Principals will be cognizant of scheduling conflicts that occur when staff is shared between schools or staff who may have a shorter lunch/prep due to other scheduling conflicts. Principals may provide flexible options for staff that have a shorter lunch period or shortened preparatory period due to travel or other exigencies.

The administration will work collaboratively with the association should a revision to this policy be necessary. This collaboration will occur prior to any revisions being presented to the Board of Trustees.
