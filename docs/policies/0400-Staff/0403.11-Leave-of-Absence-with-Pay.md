## COURT DUTY

School district personnel summoned to serve on juries are allowed their regular compensation. This policy also applies to district personnel summoned as a court witness because of their school position or summoned as a witness in a criminal trial as a direct result of actually witnessing a crime in progress.

Other court appearances may be accommodated through the use of personal leave, leave without pay, or with pay by prior approval of the board of trustees.

## ADOPTION LEAVE

District employees may be granted paid adoption leave with prior approval of the board of trustees. The Human Resourceâ€™s Administrator will determine the number of leave days allowed, depending on circumstances of the adoption case, up to a maximum of 10 working days. Adoption leave may be taken intermittently within the maximum time period of one calendar year starting from the first day adoption leave is taken.
