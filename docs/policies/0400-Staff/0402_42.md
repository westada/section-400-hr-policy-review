The board has the exclusive authority to determine the appropriate number of employees. A reduction of employees may occur as a result of, but not be limited to, changes in the education program, financial conditions or limitations of the district, staff realignment, changes in the size or demographics of the student population or at the discretion of the board of trustees for other reasons relevant to school district operations.

The board may consider performance evaluations, staff needs, date of hire, and other reasons deemed relevant by the board in order to determine the order of dismissal if it reduces classified staff or discontinues an educational service and the staff who support it.
