The Board of Trustees or the Board's designated representative(s) is hereby empowered to and shall, upon its own initiative or upon the request of the local education organization (LEO) representing a majority of the professional employees for negotiations, enter into a negotiation agreement with the LEO or the designated representative(s) of the LEO.

The negotiation process shall follow the procedures outlined in sections 33-1271 through 33-1276, Idaho Code.

The Board shall request from the LEO proof that the LEO represents fifty percent (50%) plus one (1) of West Ada School District's professional employees as defined in section 33-1272, Idaho Code, at a minimum interval of every two (2) years. The LEO shall obtain representative status in a manner that does not disrupt the educational process of the school.

Should no local education organization present evidence of representation of a majority of the professional employees, the Superintendent or designee will make a recommendation to the Board as to a representative process for the establishment of salary and benefits for the next ensuing school year.
