The Board of Trustees recognizes that exigent circumstances including but not limited to decreased enrollment, legislative changes or financial conditions may require elimination of certified staff positions.  If such actions become necessary, the Board shall declare a "Reduction In Force" (RIF).

In order to provide a fair and orderly process should such a RIF become necessary, the Board directs the Superintendent or designee to develop procedures in advance that shall be implemented following any such formal declaration.

Said procedures shall be consistent with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations and adhere to any contractual obligations present in the Negotiated Agreement.
