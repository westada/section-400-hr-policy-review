PERSONNEL RECORDS
The official personnel file will be maintained at the district service center. Complaints by students, parents, or
patrons directed toward an employee shall not become a part of the employeeâ€™s personnel file unless such
complaints have been first reported to the employee involved. The employee concerned shall be given an
opportunity to attach written comments, explanations and/or rebuttals to any such complaints.

Personnel files are confidential with the exception of information contained in the file pertaining to public service or
employment history, classification, pay grade and step, longevity, gross salary and salary history, status, workplace
and employing agency.

An employee has the right to access his or her own personnel file upon request and shall, in a timely manner, be
provided copies of materials contained in the file. However, an employee is not entitled to access letters of
recommendation or material used to screen and test for employment.

WORKING FILE
Each principal may keep for one year a working file folder on each staff member assigned to his/her building. At the
end of the academic year the working file will be purged.
