CHILD SUPPORT WITHHOLDING

The district will collect and retain $5.00 per collection in addition to the withholding order amount to reimburse administrative costs when ordered to withhold child support from an employee’s paycheck.

MAILING PAYROLL CHECKS

With administrative approval, an employee may elect to have payroll checks mailed, rather than delivered to the place of employment. The district will deduct $2.00 per paycheck to offset administrative expenses. This fee does not apply to the regular mailing of summer payroll checks or the regular mailing of substitute teacher payroll checks.

PAYROLL GARNISHMENT FEE

When ordered by the courts to make a garnishment from an employee’s paycheck, the district will collect and retain $10.00 per collection in addition to the amount of garnishment specified, in order to reimburse district administrative costs.
