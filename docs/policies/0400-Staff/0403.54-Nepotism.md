DEFINITION:

For the purpose of this policy, “relative” shall be defined as:

Father, mother, husband, wife, son, daughter, sister, brother, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, mother-in-law, father-in-
law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law.

For the purpose of this policy, “supervise” shall be defined as:

The authority to recommend or approve the relative’s appointment, promotion, salary, evaluation, termination, or
other similar personnel action.

To avoid a conflict of interest, at no time shall any administrator/supervisor be responsible for the supervision and/or
evaluation of any employee directly related to him/her. No district employee shall directly supervise another
employee who is a relative when the salary, wages, pay, or compensation of the relative will be paid from public
funds. The district employee shall not evaluate the relative’s job performance or recommend salary increases for the
relative.

Prior to adoption of this policy, employees of the district working at the same site, but not in a supervisory and/or
evaluative relationship, shall be allowed to continue until such a relationship changes.

Persons regularly employed by the district after policy adoption and prior to the inception of such relationship may
be transferred to another building or placed under different supervision, if necessary, to eliminate potential conflicts
of interest.
