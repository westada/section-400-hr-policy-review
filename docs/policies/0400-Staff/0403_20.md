Regular employees, except for all hourly employees paid strictly by blue time cards, will be paid on a 12-month basis.

Employees whose contracts are terminated during the school year shall receive as full compensation a sum to be computed by dividing the number of contract days by the annual salary, this resultant per-day salary to be multiplied by the total number of days worked by the employee.

Certified employees not renewing their contract for the ensuing year will receive their regular June, July, and August salary payments unless they make written request to the superintendent prior to June 1. Upon timely request, the June, July and August salary payments will be included in the June salary payment. NOTE: Tax deductions increase greatly and employer-paid benefits are not provided with lump sum payments.
