School equipment is not intended for personal use by employees or patrons. Exceptions must be approved by the building site administrator.

In addition, any person or group who borrows school equipment with approval must be knowledgeable as to proper operation of the equipment and shall be responsible for any loss or repair beyond normal usage.

An employee of the district transferring from one district site to another district site may not remove district equipment and/or materials without building administrator and director approval.

Equipment acquired through the grant process or from concurrent credit funds is the property of the school district. Individuals terminating employment with the district may not take any items procured from concurrent credit revenue. An employee transferring from one district site to another district site may transfer the equipment to the new site with the permission of the building administrator located at the site the employee is transferring from.
