The Board of Trustees believe that a high degree of parental and community participation in our schools enhances student learning and that volunteers perform critical functions in our schools that help to enhance the educational opportunities for all students.

All volunteers are required to sign in and wear school provided identification when they are on District property.

For the safety of our students and staff, and in compliance with provisions of Idaho Law, volunteers who may have unsupervised contact with students are required to undergo a criminal history background check under the processes and procedures of Idaho law and the District.

The Board of Trustees directs the Superintendent to establish a volunteer program and handbook consistent with this policy.
