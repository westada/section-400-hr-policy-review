title: Use of School Facilities
code: 1003.10

The Board of Trustees recognizes that our facilities are public property managed by the school district, and directs the Superintendent or designee to develop procedures to allow public rental of those facilities for non-school related activities, provided those activities do not impact instruction. Such rentals shall be consistent with the following provisions:

- Rentals shall only occur when they do not interfere with any ongoing or scheduled school activities or operations.

- Activities shall be appropriate and in the best interest of the District and its students.

- Persons occupying any facilities shall abide by all applicable Federal, State, Local and District policies, regulations and statutes.

- School-sponsored activities shall be prioritized over public rentals.

The Board grants the Superintendent or designee final authority to deny, refuse to renew, or cancel any rental agreement if any of the requirements of policy or regulation are not satisfied.

This policy governs public use only; Intergovernmental Cooperative Agreements, Joint Use Agreements and Inter-Agency Agreements shall be governed by their own contractual relationships.
