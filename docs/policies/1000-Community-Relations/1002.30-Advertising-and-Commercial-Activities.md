## Specific Limitations on District and School Based Advertising


- Following are the guidelines regarding advertising in district schools:

Idaho Not-For-Profit organizations and companies that offer programs that augment student learning may deliver paper copies of their flyers to school offices for patrons to pick up at-will.

- Logos for Identification Only. All company logos appearing on district property, including logos on materials, supplies, or equipment purchases, rented, or leased by or donated to the district, shall be for product or sponsor identification purposes only and shall conform to Idaho High School Activities Association regulations. Logos for sponsor identification purposes shall not be permitted on district property, materials, supplies, or equipment for the purpose of advertising to students. School-based personnel shall be the primary decision makers in the schools regarding whether a sponsor identification logo is for identification or advertising purposes. In determining whether the logo is for identification or advertising, the following criteria should be used; the size and location of the logo, the attention drawn to the logo compared with the intended use of the material, and the age of the students who will view it.


- Vending machine facades may be used for advertising. The name and logo of product manufacturers, such as the soft drink makers, may appear on their machines.


- Sponsorship Recognition. It is appropriate that corporate sponsors and donors receive recognition for their support. Such recognition can be in the form of the corporate name or a logo for identification purposes on the product or materials provided, or a written acknowledgement in an appropriate school publication. Corporate recognition in the form of name plates or donor walls is appropriate and authorized.
