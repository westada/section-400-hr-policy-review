Students must present an appearance that is conducive to an effective learning environment for themselves and their classmates and which does not materially interfere with school operations. Students are expected to demonstrate pride in their appearance, which reflects on them individually and collectively on the school. The Board of Trustees directs the Superintendent to establish student dress code procedures consistent with this policy.
