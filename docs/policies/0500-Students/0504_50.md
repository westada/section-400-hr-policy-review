WEST ADA SCHOOLS WILL OPERATE AS CLOSED CAMPUSES:

All West Ada schools will operate as “Closed Campus” schools in order to provide for the safety and well-being of students.

Definition: Closed campus means students are to come and remain at school until dismissed by school officials. School officials will not release students during the day without written permission from a parent or legal guardian. No student visitors are allowed to attend classes. All visitors are to report to the office.

Exceptions are:

- Parent/legal guardian may pick students up during the school day.
- Attendance at official school, off-campus activities (field trips, etc.)
- High School drivers - See Student Transportation Policy #504.40
- Sophomores may leave during lunch upon receipt of a written parent request
- Juniors, and Seniors may leave campus during lunch
