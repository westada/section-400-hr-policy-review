Generally, pregnant students will be encouraged to stay in school as close to the birth date of their child as they feel comfortable. Students are offered support based on individual needs. Support groups and individual counseling are available. Students are encouraged to return as soon after the birth as possible.

Students are required to do the regular classroom assignments or equivalent make-up work in order to retain grades and credit.
