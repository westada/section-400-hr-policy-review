 Threat Assessment

Establishing a District Threat Assessment Team represents an important component of a comprehensive approach to school safety. The Board of Trustees establishes the authority of the superintendent to appoint members of a District Threat Assessment Team. The District Threat Assessment Team will have the authority to assist building administrators in:

1. identifying student threats to commit a violent act;
1. make a reasonable judgment and determine the seriousness of the threat;
1. consult with law enforcement and/or outside agencies as needed;
1. develop intervention plans and disciplinary action that protect potential victims and help address the underlying problem or conflict that caused the threatening behavior.

For purposes of this policy threats may include, but are not limited to, verbal and nonverbal threats directed at students or adults made at school district buildings, facilities or property owned or leased by West Ada School District; on school buses; during a school sponsored event; or made using a phone or electronic device that disrupts the educational learning environment.
