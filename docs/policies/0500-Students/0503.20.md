The Board of Trustees wishes to support the principles of Freedom of Expression and Association within the student body. Accordingly, we direct the Superintendent or designee to develop procedures for secondary schools (grades 6- 12) that support curricular clubs and establish a limited open forum for non-curricular clubs.

Both types of clubs must meet the following criteria:

- All activities/events must not cause a material or substantial disruption to school operations.
- Parental/legal-guardian permission for participation.
- Appropriate participation fees, except for clubs requiring participation as part of academic course, which shall be free.
- Adhere to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations.
- Additionally, non-curricular clubs must meet the following criteria:
- Disclaim District liability for non-curricular clubs activities.
