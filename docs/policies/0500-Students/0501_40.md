A truancy occurs when a student is absent from any class without previous consent or knowledge of the parents or an appropriate school official. Repeated truancies may result in expulsion from school.

Any pupil is habitually truant who, in the judgment of the board of trustees, or the board’s designee, repeatedly has violated the attendance regulations, (for high schools and middle schools, specifics are as outlined and published in student handbooks) or any child whose parent(s) or guardian(s) failed or refused to cause such child to be instructed.

Any child under the age of sixteen (16) who accrues ten (10) absences or truancies may be referred to the prosecuting attorney pursuant to Idaho Code 33-206 which states, in part, “a habitual truant is any public school pupil who, in the judgment of the board of trustees, or the board’s designee, repeatedly has violated the attendance regulations established by the board; or any child whose parents or guardians, or any of them, have failed or refused to cause such child to be instructed as provided in section 33-202, Idaho Code, and the child shall come under the purview of the juvenile corrections act if he or she is within the age of compulsory attendance.”

Principals/assistant principals, as the authorized representative of the board of trustees, will submit documentation of the excessive absences/truancies to, the prosecuting attorney in the county of the student’s residence.
