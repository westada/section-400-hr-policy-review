# 0504.93 

To ensure consistent and immediate provisioning of life-sustaining emergency care throughout the school system, no student while under the control or supervision of the District will be denied appropriate efforts to preserve life and health regardless of "Do Not Resuscitate" (DNR) requests. Such DNR requests may be provided to the school which must forward such requests to any outside first-responders, but District personnel must provide emergency care to all students under the control and supervision of the school.

Parents may provide a copy of the DNR to the school to be given to an outside emergency response agency should the pupil need support for a life-threatening condition.
