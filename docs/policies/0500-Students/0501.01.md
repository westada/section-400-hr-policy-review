The Board of Trustees recognizes that academic integrity is necessary for students to build individual skills, knowledge, and character. Therefore, we direct the Superintendent or designee to develop procedures designed to ensure individual honesty and personal responsibility are central to the educational environment.

Such procedures shall be consistent with federal and state laws, rules and regulations and shall contain a due process provision for students.
