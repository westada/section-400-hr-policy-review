Schools should exercise great care that students are not released to persons other than parents unless parents have specifically authorized such release.

If a parent enrolls a child and notifies the school that said child is not to be released to the other parent, the school is to require this request in writing and on the basis that the other parent does not have custodial rights to the child. The request will require legal documentation providing custody rights. Until legal documentation is received, the school cannot be certain which parent has custody, and will release the student to either parent.

Unless legal evidence to the contrary is provided, both parents have access to the childâ€™s records regardless of custody status.
