The Board of Trustees recognizes the importance of innovative technologies that, when properly used, can be effective learning tools. However, improper or excessive use of such devices can detract from our goal of a distraction-free educational environment. Accordingly, the Board directs the Superintendent or designee to create procedures that limit students' access to personal electronic devices during instructional periods.
