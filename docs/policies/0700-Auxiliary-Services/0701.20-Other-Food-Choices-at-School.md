## NUTRITIOUS FOOD CHOICES
Nutritious and appealing foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, and low-fat grain products, will be available wherever food is sold or otherwise offered at school. Schools will take efforts to encourage students to make nutritious food choices.

To provide a wider selection and greater choice, food service will explore working relationships with the business community.

## FOOD SALES
Food and beverages may not be sold within the cafeteria or school nutrition serving area from vending machines or school stores 30 minutes before breakfast, break or lunch serving periods and 30 minutes after each serving period, unless they are part of the school nutrition program.

Foods sold for fundraising purposes may not be sold in the same room where school nutrition meals are being served.

The elementary schools are encouraged to limit access to food and beverages sold in vending machines or school stores.
