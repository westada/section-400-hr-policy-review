 0704.10: Trampolines, Rebounding Devices, Bounce Houses and Loadbearing Inflatables


The use of trampolines/mini-trampolines, bounce houses, inflatable slides, other loadbearing inflatables, or rebounding devices are not allowed in the West Ada School District, with the exception of an individual student under the provisions of IDEA or Section 504. In these cases, limited use of a mini-trampoline or rebounding device may be appropriate, solely as addressed in the individual student's identified IEP/Section 504 Plan.

For the purpose of this policy, a rebounding device is defined as a device that springs back and/or causes one to bounce or thrust at a speed greater than the speed obtained from springing or jumping from a hard surface.

Parent Teacher Organizations (PTO), Parent Teacher Associations (PTA) and Booster organizations who hold their own liability insurance that covers bounce houses and inflatables, may choose to provide bounce houses or inflatables for PTO/PTA/Booster-sponsored events or activities as long as the event or activity is held outside of the school day.

The Superintendent or designee shall establish protocols for the limited use of rebounding devices and mini- trampolines as addressed in this policy.
