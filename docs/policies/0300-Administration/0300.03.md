title: 0300.03 Supervision and Evaluations â€“ Administrators/Supervisors
code: "0300.03"
kind: Policy
---

Evaluation of employees promotes excellence and improves overall job performance. Multiple measures are utilized in which the evaluation criteria and procedures for the evaluation are research based and aligned to Charlotte Danielson Framework for Teaching Second Edition.

Throughout the school year, evaluators must make a concerted effort to observe the performance of the administrator/supervisor. This includes substantial direction, observation and gathering of input from a variety of constituents, including teachers, patrons, students, classified personnel, and district office personnel. The key to successful evaluations and performance improvement is regular dialogue and feedback about performance observations.

A timeline for goal setting, mid-year, and annual evaluations will be established and approved by the board. A superintendent-approved administrator/supervisor evaluation document will be used and submitted to the appropriate supervisor, and a copy will be placed in their personnel file at the end of the evaluation cycle.
