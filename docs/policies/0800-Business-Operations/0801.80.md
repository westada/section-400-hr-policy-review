The operating budget will balance the current expenditures with current revenues. The budget may include beginning fund balances less required reserves as established by the board.

The district will avoid budgetary procedures that cover current expenditures at the expense of meeting future year’s expenditures, such as postponing expenditures, accruing future years’ revenues, or rolling over short-term debt.

Due to the level of state funding, this policy is suspended for the 2020-2021 school year
