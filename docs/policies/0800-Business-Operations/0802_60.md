All goods will be inspected and their receipt documented upon delivery prior to any payments. All services will be complete and approved by an administrator prior to any payments.

The board of trustees’ grants authority to the superintendent or designee to issue checks for all invoices received when the expenditure for the goods or services was pre-approved through the budget process and the payment of such bills are necessary for the proper operation of the district.

## Receipt of Goods

When materials are initially received, a district employee will:

- Note any damage or shortages on shipping documents and notify the building principal or supervisor as soon as possible;
- Check the shipment against the purchase order and invoice;
- Route the goods received to the person for whom the goods were ordered.

The building secretary, bookkeeper or other responsible personnel will enter necessary data into the district’s computer system to complete the receiving process.

## Payment of Bills

At the first regularly scheduled meeting of the month, the board of trustees will consider approval of the following
items:

- A list of all checks issued from the previous month to cover unpaid invoices processed by the accounting
department.
- A list of all manual checks issued from the previous month including those approved by the superintendent.
