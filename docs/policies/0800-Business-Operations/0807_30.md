The District will strive to maintain a stable, diversified revenue system to shelter it from short term fluctuations in
any one revenue source and ensure its ability to fund ongoing operations.

Restricted revenue shall be used only for the purpose legally permissible and in a fiscally responsible manner.
Programs and services funded by restricted revenue will be clearly designated as such.

One-time revenue will be used on time-limited services, capital projects, equipment requirements, or services that
can be terminated without significant disruption to the District organization.
