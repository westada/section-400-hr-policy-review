During the year the school district accepts checks from parents and employees for payment of school meals, activity fees, and other charges. Because of the additional costs to collect NSF checks, the district will now charge a $20.00 service fee for a non-sufficient check. Persons who have written two or more non-sufficient checks will lose check writing privileges with the district.

## School Nutrition
The district will not accept any checks with the signators address being out- of-state. If an out of state check is received for school meals, it will be returned and the student will be allowed to charge lunches for up to three days, at that time the lunch account must be paid using a local check, cash or money order.
