# 0807.40 Fees and Charges

Fees and charges will be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure that they keep pace with the cost of
providing the goods and/or services for which the fees and charges are collected as well as changes in methods or
levels of service or goods provided.

The following general concepts will be used in developing and implementing fees and charges:

Revenues should not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the goods or service.

Cost recovery goals should be based on the total cost of delivering the service, including direct costs, departmental
administration costs, and organization-wide support costs such as accounting, personnel, data processing, vehicle
maintenance, and insurance.

The method of assessing and collecting fees should be as simple as possible in order to reduce the administrative
cost of collection.

Rate structures should be sensitive to the “market” for similar services as well as to smaller, infrequent users of the
service.
