Budget planning is a critical element in meeting the Board’s goals. The Board’s role in budget planning is to ensure that the budget:

- Reflects the District’s Strategic Plan and supports the District’s goals and objectives;
- Reflects priorities between and within programs;
- Considers both short and long range funding sources and expenditures.

The Superintendent shall cause to be prepared a budget preparation calendar, which shall ensure all deadlines established by law for budget presentation, hearings and adoption are met and that all deadlines for certification of tax levies are met.
