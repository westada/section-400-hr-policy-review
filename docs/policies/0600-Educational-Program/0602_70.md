All West Ada School District high schools serving grades 9-12 are required to attain accredited status through Cognia (formerly AdvancED) a division of AdvancED. West Ada School District elementary and middle schools may voluntarily seek Cognia accreditation.

In accordance with Cognia requirements, each accredited school must undergo an onsite Engagement Review every five (5) years by a team comprised of current and former educators from surrounding districts approved by the Cognia team chair and school principal. The visiting teamâ€™s report will be submitted to the Board of Trustees.

Schools accredited by Cognia must submit annual updates as directed by Cognia each year to maintain accreditation status.
