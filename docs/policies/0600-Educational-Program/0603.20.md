The Board of Trustees stipulates the following graduation requirements in accordance with standards outlined by the Idaho State Board of Education and accredited by Cognia. Our goal is to provide a clear and consistent path to graduation based on academic credits earned at the secondary school level, resulting in a diploma conferred by the West Ada School District, with all the honors and privileges granted thereto.

## Credits
The Board mandates the following regarding the accumulation of credits toward graduation:

- **Allocation**: One (1) unit of credit shall be granted for successful completion of coursework per semester, with each semester equivalent to one- half (1/2) of the academic year. Credit will be recognized only for high school courses completed in accredited high schools, as per Idaho Administrative Rule. High School credit may be granted for courses taken during middle school according to a set of criteria established by the Superintendent or designee.

- **Extended Learning Opportunities**: Students may earn credits for extended learning experiences outside traditional classrooms, including enrichment opportunity, career readiness programs, internships/apprenticeships, and other educational activities (volunteering and work). Accordingly, the Superintendent or designee shall develop a set of procedures consistent with this objective which adhere to all relevant state and federal statute and regulations.

## Requirements
Diplomas earned from a school must match the graduation requirements of that school, which are listed below:
