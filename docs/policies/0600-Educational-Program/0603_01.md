## Placement

The goal of the District and its administration shall be to place each student at a level, grade and in a setting that will enhance the probability of the student's success, along with providing challenging coursework/classes.

The grade level placement shall be based upon multiple factors including the student's level of curricular mastery. Placement may include individual review with the parent/legal guardian, building administration, teacher(s), IEP Team, counseling personnel and any other school personnel with information relevant to the decision-making process.

The superintendent or designee shall determine final placement based upon the best long term educational interests of the child.

## Acceleration/Retention

The superintendent of designee will establish criteria and procedures to accelerate or retain students. These processes will include parent/guardian(s) input. Absent extraordinary circumstances, such acceleration/retention decisions shall only occur once per student per school year.
