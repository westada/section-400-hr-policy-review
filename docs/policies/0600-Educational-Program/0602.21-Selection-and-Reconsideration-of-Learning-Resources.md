title: Selection and Reconsideration of Learning Resources

# 0602.21 

## Philosophy


The Board of Trustees  supports the intellectual freedom principle inherent in the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and encourages the accessibility of age/grade appropriate learning resources at various levels of difficulty, diversity of appeal, and differing viewpoints.[^library-bor]

Therefore, consistent with the laws and regulations of the State of Idaho, the Board of Trustees directs the Superintendent or designee(s) to identify and select learning resources in accordance with this principle. For the purposes of this statement of policy, the term “learning resources” will refer to any inventoried material, including supplemental materials, print, or digital resources used in any type of classroom setting,  with instructional content or in a function that is used for formal or informal teaching/learning purposes.

## Selection of Learning Resources

The Board of Trustees directs the Superintendent or designee to establish procedures for the selection of learning resources consistent with the following:

1. Learning resources shall be selected based on their ties to the curriculum, intended audience, age/grade appropriateness and student interest.
2. Learning resources shall be selected for their overall strengths rather than rejected for their weaknesses.

The above criteria shall apply to all learning resources regardless of source (i.e. whether acquired through grant, purchase or offered gratis) before entering circulation).  All materials from all sources, including those donated, gifted, granted, or otherwise offered gratis, shall be subject to the above criteria before entering circulation.

## Reconsideration of Learning Resources

The Board of Trustees directs the Superintendent or designee to establish procedures for the reconsideration of learning resources consistent with the following:

- Only District students, affected patrons (defined as the parent/legal guardian of a current West Ada student) or employees shall have standing to initiate reconsideration of a learning resource.
- A District parent or guardian has the right to request a reasonable alternative supplemental learning resource for his/her child.
- Access to the challenged material will  not be restricted during the reconsideration process, unless otherwise required by Idaho Code.
- A decision to sustain a challenge shall not necessarily be interpreted as a judgment of irresponsibility by the professionals involved in the original selection and/or use of the material.
- Materials which have undergone a challenge, may not be challenged again until three calendar years after the recommendation of the committee.

Notwithstanding the above, the Board of Trustees reserves the right to make a final decision regarding any challenged resource in a situation where two or more Board Members or the Chair determine to place the matter on the Board of Trustee's Agenda.
