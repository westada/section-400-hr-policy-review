title: Class Size and Load

The board of trustees of West Ada School District recognizes the importance of a low teacher/student ratio and strives to decrease class size where appropriate when funding and facilities permit. It is important to provide a learning environment that is positive and productive for every child in the classroom. This can best be achieved if class enrollments are maintained at manageable levels.

The standard used to determine maximum enrollment in regular elementary classrooms is:

- Kindergarten, grades 1, 2 25
- Grade 3 26
- Grades 4, 5 32

Any regular* classroom in an elementary school that has one (1) or more students over the maximum enrollment specified in this policy shall be eligible for a district employed aide to assist at least one (1) hour per day per over- enrolled student in that classroom unless the option available to a teacher in the negotiated agreement is applied.
*does not include specials or special education

The standard used to guide maximum enrollment in regular secondary classrooms is:

- Middle Schools 180 teacher load
- High School 192 teacher load
- Alternative School 18 average daily class load

Secondary schools will strive to meet these guidelines but situations may arise which may cause class loads to be larger than the guideline. Secondary class load numbers do not apply to physical education or elective classes that require large student numbers.

The State Board of Education has established, as part of the State Rules and Regulations, student enrollment goals as follows:*

- Kindergarten 20
- Grades1, 2, 3 20
- Grades 4, 5, 6 26
- Middle School 160 teacher load
- High School 160 teacher load
- Alternative School (7-12) 18 average daily class load

*The State Board of Education class size goals include all certified staff in the calculation of average class size including Pupil Services Staff (Counselors, Nurses, etc...). For the purposes of this West Ada School District policy, Pupil Services Staff are not part of the class-load calculation.
