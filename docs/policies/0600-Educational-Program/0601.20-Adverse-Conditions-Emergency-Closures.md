The Board of Trustees grants the Superintendent or designee permission to close or move to remote instruction any or all schools in the West Ada School District in the event of an emergency, facilities failure, or adverse conditions.

The Superintendent or designee will promptly notify the members of the Board of Trustees, media, and parents when such decisions are made.   Notwithstanding such closures, the Superintendent or designee is authorized to require certain employees or groups of employees to report to work normally.   

When school closures exceed eleven instructional hours per school year, the Board of Trustees may adjust the school year calendar to meet the statutory requirements per Idaho Code 33-512[^ic-33-512].
