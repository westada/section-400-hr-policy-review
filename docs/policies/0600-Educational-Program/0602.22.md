## IDAHO DIGNITY AND NONDISCRIMINATION IN PUBLIC EDUCATION ACT

The Idaho Legislature has enacted the Dignity and Nondiscrimination in Public Education Act with the stated intent that the administrators, faculty members and other employees and students in public schools respect the dignity of others, acknowledge the right of others to express differing opinions and foster and defend intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and instruction and freedom of speech and association. All staff are expected to follow the express language and intentions stated in law. (Section 33-138, Idaho Code).

It is the position of the District that this law does not prevent a discussion with a student should a student or guardian raise issue regarding the student’s: religion or religious beliefs, political affiliation, sex/sexual orientation or gender identity, ethnicity, race, color, national origin or a student’s medical history or status.

Further, it is the position of the District that Health Services Staff or other District personnel may engage in discussion regarding a student’s medical status during the provision of medical care, when addressing medical emergencies or to provide for the student’s safety.
