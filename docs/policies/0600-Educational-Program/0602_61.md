West Ada School District shall provide instruction and training for children between the ages of five (5) and eighteen (18) years of age who are gifted/talented. “Gifted/talented children” means those students who are identified as possessing demonstrated or potential abilities that give evidence of high performing capabilities in intellectual, creative, specific academic or leadership areas, or ability in the performing or visual arts and who require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to fully develop such capabilities. These services will be provided in a variety of flexible approaches for instruction and training that may include administrative accommodations, curriculum modifications, and special programs. Students shall meet the criteria established by the district for placement in the district’s Gifted and Talented Program.
