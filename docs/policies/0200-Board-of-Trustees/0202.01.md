A quorum for the the consideration of action items shall consist of three (3) board members.

All action items shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast. The chairman of the board may vote in all cases.

All voting shall take place in an open meeting except as specifically permitted by Idaho Code.

Idaho Code 33-205[^ic-33-205] requires a student expulsion hearing motion to be held in executive session. Idaho Code 33-514[^ic-33-514] and 33-515[^ic-33-515] permits a board of a public school district to vote on a recommendation for a Category III or a Renewable Contract teacher to be placed on probation during executive session.

An executive session may be held by the board for the limited reasons specified in Idaho Code. The motion to enter into executive session shall identify the specific lawful basis for the board to enter into executive session. There shall be a roll call vote on such motion and the vote shall be recorded in the minutes. An executive session shall be authorized by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the board. If the Board has vacancies such that less than two-thirds (2/3) of the board members have been seated, the board may enter into executive session on a simple roll call majority vote.
