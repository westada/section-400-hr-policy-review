The duties and responsibilities of the Board of Trustees shall be carried out in accordance with the Idaho Constitution[^idaho-constitution], Idaho Statute[^ic-33], and State Board of Education Rules and Regulations[^idapa-08], exercising a duty of care, duty of loyalty and duty of obedience to the District.

Specifically, the Board of Trustees shall:

1. Set Policy for the District, including but not limited to: Board Policy, the District's Mission, Strategic Plan and Continuous Improvement Plan.
1. Secure Resources for the District, including but not limited to: employing the Superintendent, acting upon administrative recommendations for staffing, and obtaining appropriate funding for the effective operations of the District.
1. Provide Oversight on the Superintendent and District Operations, including but not limited to: assurance of effective policy implementation and maintenance of fiscal discipline.

The Board of Trustees expressly acknowledges that the Superintendent is the executive officer of the District with direct management over operational concerns, and that excessive engagement with the Superintendent or administration may negatively impact the normal activity of the District. Accordingly, it is the position of the Board of Trustees that members refrain from direct involvement on operational matters in an individual capacity outside of properly formed committees or other normal processes.
