# 0200.01 Legal Status and General Power

A thorough system of public, free common schools is required by Article IX of the Idaho State Constitution.[^article9]

Accordingly, the West Ada School District is granted authority in Idaho Statute to operate as a body politic per section 33-301, Idaho Code[^ic-33-301], and will be governed by a Board of Trustees per section 33-501, Idaho Code.[^ic-33-501]

The Board of Trustees may only act when sitting as a quorum, in legal session. Members of the Board of Trustees, individually, have no powers to act on behalf of the District or the Board.
