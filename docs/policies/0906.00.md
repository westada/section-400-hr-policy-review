**Discontinuation of a Public School**

The Board of Trustees has the power and duty to discontinue any school within the District when it finds such discontinuation to be in the best interest of the District and students. 

For the purposes of this Policy, discontinuance shall mean no longer maintaining a school of any type, at the same location.   The Board directs the Superintendent or designee to develop procedures for the discontinuation of any school within the District, consistent with the Idaho Code and Idaho Administrative Procedures Act

Idaho Code 33-511(3)
