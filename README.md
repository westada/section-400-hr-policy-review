# PLEASE NOTE

This is a test version of a new system (GitHub) that the West Ada School District is currently exploring to support the organization and management of Board Policies and Administrative Regulations (ARs) associated with the West Ada School District Board of Trustees.

This platform is in an experimental phase and intended for internal use only. As such, the content presented here does not represent official West Ada School District policy or procedure.

## HOW TO USE

GitHub is a product designed to facilitate collaboration on shared documents through time.  It is primarily used to manage computer code, but also is a convenient way to track our policies and ARs (which function in analogous ways.)  To learn more about how this process works at a high-level, you can [read more here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)

In terms of organization, Policies and Administrative regulations are written in text format, and are located in the `docs` folder under `policies` and `regulations`, respectively.  All other folders are used by the system and can be safely ignored.

Within `policies` and `regulations`, folders are organized by section.  For the purposes of this project most changes are located in the `0400-staff` folder, and each policy/AR file is named according to the policy/AR section.  

Within each file there is a file header at the top that represents meta-data about the policy/AR used by the system that can be safely ignored. The files can be read in the browser in a variety of different formats, or downloaded to your local computer to be read in whatever application you wish.  

The system maintains two separate and entirely self-contained versions of our policies/ARs (called 'branches') that you can toggle between.  All of the text is either current or proposed, depending on which branch you are in.

- To read the current official policies, view the [current branch](https://github.com/westada/section-400-hr-policy-review/tree/current).

- To read the proposed draft policies, view the [proposed branch](https://github.com/westada/section-400-hr-policy-review/tree/proposed). 

- To compare the original against the draft, view this [comparison](https://github.com/westada/section-400-hr-policy-review/compare/current...proposed).

Thank you for your interest.  We hope you find this system transparent and useful.
