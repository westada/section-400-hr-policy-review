# PLEASE NOTE

This is a test version of a new system (GitHub) that the West Ada School District is currently exploring to support the organization and management of Board Policies and Administrative Regulations (ARs) associated with the West Ada School District Board of Trustees.

This platform is in an experimental phase and intended for internal use only. As such, the content presented here does not represent official West Ada School District policy or procedure.

**For the most up-to-date and official information, including policies, meeting minutes, and regulations, please visit:**

## HOW TO USE

Policies and Administrative regulations are written in text format, and are located in the `docs` folder under `policies` and `regulations`, respectively.  All other folders are used by the system and can be safely ignored.

Within `policies` and `regulations`, folders are organized by section.  For the purposes of this project most changes are located in the `0400-staff` folder, and each policy/AR file is named according to the policy/AR name.  

Within each file there is a file header that represents meta-data about the policy/AR that can be safely ignored. The files can be read in the browser in a variety of different formats.  

The system maintains two separate and entirely self-contained versions of our policies/ARs that you can toggle between.

- To read the current official policies, view the [main branch](https://github.com/westada/section-400-hr-policy-review/tree/main).

- To read the proposed draft policies, view the [section-400 branch](https://github.com/westada/section-400-hr-policy-review/tree/section-400).

- To compare the original against the draft, view this [comparison](https://github.com/westada/section-400-hr-policy-review/compare/main...section-400).

We hope you find this useful, transparent, and easy to process.
