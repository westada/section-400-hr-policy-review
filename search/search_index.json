The goal is to simplify, clarify, and update all District policies.  So far, the Board has approved revisions to Sections 100, 200 and 300; Section 400 is simply next in line.</p> <p>Generally, the Policy Review Committee recommends policy changes one-at-a-time.  However, the complexity and inter-dependency of Section 400 made this effectively impossible.  As a result, we decided to address Section 400 as a whole, with the intention of presenting all recommendations holistically.  This required the use of a new tool (GitHub) from which this site is built.</p> <p>This website represents how the entire policy manual would look if all the proposed changes were accepted by the Board of Trustees (including policies unaffected by the rework).  This site will be updated in real-time as proposals are adjusted based on feedback from patrons, personnel and Trustees, and may be used as a reference during work sessions discussing the Section 400 rework.  The goal is to have all Section 400 policies completed and approved prior to July 1 so that District personnel have an opportunity to review and adjust before the start of the 2025-2026 school year.</p>"},{"location":"#understanding-policy-and-regulations-ars","title":"Understanding Policy and Regulations (ARs)","text":"<p>There are two components to this site, Policies and Administrative Regulations.</p> <p>Policies are set by the Board of Trustees.  They tend to be declarative, general, and strategic.  Policies are meant to address \"what\" the District is attempting to accomplish.</p> <p>Administrative Regulations, or ARs, are set by the Administration through the Superintendent.  They tend to be imperative, specific, and tactical.  ARs are meant to address \"how\" the District accomplishes the \"what\". </p> <p>Every Policy is voted on by the Board of Trustees in open session, typically after a three-reading process.  These may be commented on by the public and remain in force until and unless superseded by statute or rescinded by the Board (again, typically following a three-reading process in open session.)</p> <p>Every AR is written by the Administration and can change at any time.  However, any changes in Administrative Regulation must be presented to the Board in open session (typically on the \"consent agenda\") allowing for oversight.</p> <p>The goal with this approach is to maintain the ultimate authority with the People through their elected representatives, while still allowing the district professionals to manage the day-to-day operations with flexibility and responsiveness to on-the-ground conditions.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>There has been substantial public interest in one specific policy (Policy 401.20) that addresses classroom displays.  As part of the Section 400 rework, this particular policy was split up into various parts several months ago and as such 401.20 itself will not be found on this site.

School attendance areas will be adjusted when new school capacity is added either through the construction of a new school, when an addition increases capacity at an existing school, or the overcrowded condition at a school requires moving a large number of students to a less crowded school. All boundary recommendations and decisions will consider the following criteria:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The creation or modification of school attendance areas shall not knowingly promote inequitable student assignments based on racial or ethnic groups, family income, religion, or disabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>The capacity of each facility shall be considered to ensure optimal utilization of space while also planning for future enrollment increases.</p> </li> <li> <p>Emergency portables (portables; non-educational spaces that have been converted into classrooms) will generally not be considered available capacity when creating or adjusting attendance areas.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The Board of Trustees will consider but will not be limited to the following criteria while considering proposals to alter or create school attendance areas. The considerations are listed in rank order of their relative importance while making attendance area recommendations to and decisions by the Board of Trustees:</p> <ul> <li>Optimal Design Capacity: The overriding goal of altering school attendance areas is to reduce enrollment and relieve overcrowding. No other criteria holds greater weight while evaluating proposals to alter existing attendance areas or establishing an attendance area for a new school.</li> </ul> <p>Program Capacity: In addition to balancing enrollment based on a school\u2019s optimum design capacity, special programs that are housed in existing schools will be considered before increasing a school\u2019s enrollment. Attendance area proposals will consider special programs as part of a school\u2019s general operations. As a general practice, these programs will not be moved in order to create more space in an existing school facility.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Safety. Roads with heavy traffic and safety concerns created by open canals will be considered when establishing attendance areas. In particular, school attendance areas that cross busy roads should be avoided to prevent students from crossing these roads even when safety busing is provided.</p> </li> <li> <p>Minimizing the Number of Students Moved. Attendance area proposals should achieve reducing enrollment and reducing overcrowding while doing so by changing schools for the fewest students possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feeder Schools. Attendance area proposals should consider the percentage of students who will stay with their peers as they move from the elementary school to middle school to high school. The various capacity configuration of schools in West Ada does not allow for a system where 100% of all students from one school move up to the next school level stay together. Efforts should be made to keep as large a percentage of students with their peers together as possible as they transition from elementary, middle and high school.</p> </li> <li> <p>Walk Zones. An analysis of the cost of bus transportation will be provided to the Board of Trustees when students who are currently walking to a school are proposed to be bused to a different school. These costs should be minimized whenever possible. Relative driving distance between schools is not a part of this consideration.</p> </li> <li> <p>Moving Students Multiple Times. Using projected enrollment increases, attendance area changes should consider if proposed changes to an attendance area will be reversed or changed when future attendance areas are created in the future. Unless no other options exist to balance enrollment and reduce overcrowding, no set of students will be required to change schools due to the adoption of new attendance areas more than one time during elementary, middle, or high school.</p> </li> <li> <p>Current Students and Future Enrollment. Attendance area proposals should include an analysis of both current students and new students based on projections of increased enrollment created by subdivisions that have been approved for construction at the time the attendance area proposal is created.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"policies/0900-Buildings-and-Sites/0904.00/#attendance-area-development-process","title":"ATTENDANCE AREA DEVELOPMENT PROCESS","text":"<p>Re-drawing attendance areas should be a public process that involves as many interested patrons as possible:</p> <p>Administration presents to the Board of Trustees a proposal that includes the extent of the attendance area changes that will be included in the process of re-drawing existing attendance areas.

The process should begin no later than the fall prior to the opening of a new school with meetings that inform the community of the overcrowding issues that will be resolved by redrawing existing attendance areas. At these meetings, interested patrons can volunteer to serve on the attendance area committee. The size of the committee should be limited to 15 people, including volunteers and district staff Permanent Attendance Area Committee. West Ada should maintain volunteers on a permanent attendance area committee.

This includes threatening charges against an individual for Code of Ethics or code of conduct violations that do not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment. The District shall keep confidential the identity of:<ul> <li>Any individual who has made a report or Complaint of sex discrimination, including any individual who has made a report or filed a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment;</li> <li>Any Complainant;</li> <li>Any individual who has been reported to be the perpetrator of sex discrimination;</li> <li>Any Respondent; and</li> <li>Any witness</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>except:</p> <ul> <li>As may be permitted by FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g) or a FERPA regulation (34 CFR Part 99);</li> <li>As required by law; or</li> <li>To carry out the purposes of this procedure, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.</li> </ul> <p>Complaints alleging retaliation may be filed as an additional charge or counter-charge under these procedures.</p> <ul> <li>Additional Charges: If, during the investigation, it is determined based on the information gathered that additional allegations or charges are warranted, an Amended Notice shall be prepared and submitted to the parties including the new/additional allegations and charges as appropriate.</li> <li>Consolidation: The Coordinator may consolidate two or more Formal Complaints into a single action provided that the allegations arise out of a common set of facts or circumstances and if in the course of an investigation, it is determined that:<ul> <li>There is more than one Respondent and/or more than one Complainant; or</li> <li>There are cross-Complaints, or additional Complaints raised by the original Complainant against the original Respondent (such as retaliation), or by the Respondent against any other party.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>In the situation of a consolidation, there is no \u201clead Complainant\u201d, each party independently receives Notices and evidence for review.  In the context of a grievance process that involves multiple Complainants, multiple Respondents, or both, the District may issue a single Investigative Report.    All parties to a consolidated Complaint will also receive the same written determination (The parties must receive the same written determination of responsibility, although the determination of responsibility may be different with respect to each allegation depending upon the facts.   The written determination must be provided simultaneously to the parties and may not be redacted.</p> <p>In the event of cross-Complaints, each party is entitled to the rights attached to their respective status.   In other words, a Respondent filing a cross-Complaint against the Complainant would be entitled to request Supportive Measures typically reserved for the Complainant.   Likewise, evidentiary exclusions such a \u201crape shield\u201d provision would apply to the Respondent in their status as a Complainant.</p> <ol> <li>Conduct of the Investigation</li> </ol> <p>Once it is determined that an investigation is to occur, the Coordinator shall assign an investigator.   The Coordinator and Investigator can confer in preparation of the investigation as to the strategy and process of the investigation.</p> <p>Investigation:   Investigation shall include, but not be limited to, interviews of the Complainant, Respondent as well as any witnesses; the collection and review of any evidence submitted by either party or independently discovered including such matters as video recordings, text messages, photographs, e-mails, social media; and review of District policies and procedures, etc.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Burden of Investigation: The burden of gathering evidence sufficient to make a determination of responsibility is the charge of the District\u2019s Investigator(s) and not the parties.</p> <ul> <li>However, the District\u2019s Investigator is not authorized to access a party\u2019s records that are made or maintained by a health care provider if the record was made in the course of providing treatment to the party, unless written consent from an authorized person is provided to obtain such privileged records for purposes of investigating and resolving the allegations of the Formal Complaint.</li> <li>Evidence Offered by Parties: The parties shall be provided an equal opportunity to identify witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, as well as other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.</li> <li>No Restrictions: The ability of the parties to discuss the allegations under investigation or to gather and present evidence shall not be restricted.</li> <li>Equal Representation Rights: All parties shall have the same opportunity to have others present, or to be represented by the advisor of their choice throughout the grievance process, including attendance at related meetings or proceedings. If the District limits access to representation in any way at any time during the proceedings, such limitation shall be equally applied to all parties in the same manner.<ul> <li>Access to representation may be limited only where a party is already represented as authorized by this procedure, and the additional representation will unduly increase the cost to the parties, and/or will not otherwise serve to significantly promote a legitimate purpose under this procedure.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Notice of Interviews: Adequate notice of the purpose, date, time, place, and the identities of all participants involved shall be provided to any party whose participation at an interview or meeting is invited or expected, and allowing sufficient time for the party to prepare and fairly participate.</li> <li>Evidentiary Considerations: The investigation shall not consider:<ul> <li>Incidents not directly related to the possible violation, unless they evidence a pattern;</li> <li>The character of the parties; or</li> <li>Questions and evidence about the Complainant\u2019s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainant\u2019s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant\u2019s prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove Consent.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Right to Inspect Evidence: All parties shall be provided equal access to inspect and review any or all evidence gathered during the investigation related to the allegations of the Formal Complaint, whether or not relied upon or referred to in the Investigative Report. This will ensure that the parties can respond to the evidence prior to the conclusion of the investigation.</li> <li>Prior to completion of the Investigative Report, the Investigator shall provide the parties and their respective advisors, if any, a secure electronic or hard copy of the evidence subject to inspection. The parties must have at least ten (10) calendar days to submit a written response which the Investigator shall consider prior to completion of the Investigative Report.</li> <li>Investigative Report: At least ten (10) calendar days prior to any determination regarding responsibility, the Title IX Coordinator shall send to all parties and their advisors, if any, by electronic format or hard copy, a copy of the investigative report for the parties\u2019 review and written response. The parties\u2019 responses shall be made part of the record.</li> <li>Subsequent to the above-stated time frames, with inclusion of responses for the record, the Coordinator shall notify the parties that the Investigative Report and evidentiary materials will be forwarded to the Decision-Maker to make a responsibility determination.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Informal Resolution Process</p> </li> </ul> <p>The Informal Resolution Process may include mediation, or other meeting of the parties that does not involve a full investigation and adjudication of the Formal Complaint.</p> <p>The District may not require the parties to participate in an Informal Resolution Process. Informal Resolution is available only if a written Formal Complaint was submitted to the Coordinator. If these conditions are satisfied, then at any time during an investigation, but prior to the time of the Decision-Maker\u2019s final determination of responsibility, the parties may request the Coordinator to initiate the Informal Resolution Process. In so doing, the Coordinator is required to comply with the following:</p> <ul> <li>Provide the parties with written notice informing them of the allegations at issue and the requirements of the resolution process. These requirements include the fact that a written agreement signed by the parties that resolves the allegations at issue will preclude the parties from resuming the Formal Complaint process that arose from the same allegations. The parties will also be informed that at any time prior to reaching a resolution, any party has the right to withdraw from the Informal Resolution Process and resume the grievance process with respect to the Formal Complaint, and will be notified that the records submitted or discussed during the Informal Resolution Process will be maintained by the District as part of the record, and may be used by the Decision-Maker to determine responsibility.</li> <li>Require the parties submit voluntary, written consent to participate in the Informal Resolution Process.</li> <li>Ensure that the Informal Resolution Process is not made available to resolve allegations that an employee Sexually Harassed a student.</li> <li> <p>An Informal Resolution, signed and agreed to by the parties thereto, is not appealable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dismissal of a Formal Complaint:</p> </li> </ul> <p>A written Formal Complaint may be dismissed by the Coordinator under any of the following circumstances, and prior to a finding of responsibility:</p> <ul> <li>If the Complainant notifies the Coordinator in writing that he or she would like to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any allegations contained therein.</li> <li>If the Respondent is no longer enrolled or employed by the District.</li> <li>If specific circumstances exist which prevent the Investigator from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding the merits of the Formal Complaint or allegations therein.</li> </ul> <p>After investigating the allegations of the written Formal Complaint, dismissal is required if:</p> <ul> <li>The Coordinator or designee determines that the conduct alleged in the Complaint, even if proven, would not constitute Sexual Harassment as defined herein; or</li> <li>The alleged conduct did not occur in a District education program or activity; or</li> <li>The alleged conduct did not occur against a person in the United States.</li> </ul> <p>Dismissal of the Title IX Formal Complaint, however, does not preclude action under another provision of the District\u2019s Policy.</p> <p>Upon dismissing a Formal Complaint, the Coordinator shall simultaneously inform the parties in writing that the Formal Complaint has been dismissed and shall identify the reason(s) for the dismissal. This decision may be appealed in accordance with the Appeals portion of this procedure, below.</p> <ol> <li>Decision-Maker\u2019s Participation/ Determination Process</li> </ol> <p>If the matter is not dismissed for one of the reasons set forth above and is not resolved by the parties through the Informal Resolution Process then, following completion of the investigation, including issuance of the Investigator\u2019s Final Investigative Report, the matter shall be submitted to the Decision-Maker(s) for review and issuance of a determination of responsibility.</p> <p>The Decision-Maker(s) cannot make a determination regarding responsibility until ten (10) calendar days after the date the Final Investigative Report is transmitted to the parties and the Decision-Maker(s), unless all parties and the Decision-Maker(s) agree to an expedited timeline.</p> <p>The Coordinator shall designate the Decision-Maker(s) and inform the parties and their advisors of the designation of the Decision-Maker(s).</p> <p>The Decision-Maker(s) may not have had any previous involvement with the investigation. Those who have served as Investigators in the investigation cannot serve as Decision-Maker(s). Those who are serving as advisors for any party cannot serve as Decision-Maker(s) in that matter. The Coordinator is also prohibited from serving as a Decision-Maker in the matter.</p> <p>All objections to any Decision-Maker must be raised in writing. Any written objection must detail the rationale for the objection and must be submitted to the Coordinator no later than three (3) calendar days after being notified of the Decision-Maker\u2019s identity. Decision-Makers shall not be removed unless the Coordinator concludes that the Decision-Maker\u2019s bias or conflict of interest precludes a fair and impartial consideration of the evidence.</p> <p>The Coordinator shall give the Decision-Maker(s) a list of the names of all parties, witnesses, and advisors. Upon review thereof, if any Decision-Maker believes they cannot make an objective determination, they must recuse themselves from the proceedings. If a Decision-Maker is unsure whether a bias or conflict of interest exists, they shall immediately disclose their concern(s) to the Coordinator and simultaneously inform the parties and their advisors.</p> <p>No less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the decision-making phase of the process, the Coordinator or the Decision-Maker(s) shall send notice to all parties.

This information may only be considered at the sanction stage of the process and cannot be shared with the Decision-Maker until that time.</p> <ul> <li>Commencement of Exchange of Questions Procedure:</li> </ul> <p>The Coordinator will initiate the Exchange of Questions Procedure.</p> <p>Prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility, the Decision-Maker(s) shall provide each party with an opportunity to submit written, relevant questions that the party desires to ask of any party or witness and shall subsequently provide each party with the answers.  The Decision-Maker will also allow for additional, limited follow-up questions from each party to the other, and provide both with complete copies of the answers.</p> <p>Upon receipt of the proposed questions, the Decision-Maker will review the proposed questions and determine which questions will be permitted, disallowed, or rephrased. The Decision-Maker shall limit or disallow any questions that are irrelevant, repetitive (and thus irrelevant), or abusive.</p> <p>The Decision-Maker shall have full authority to decide all issues related to questioning and determinations of relevance.</p> <p>The Decision-Maker, after any necessary consultation with the parties, investigator(s), and/or Coordinator, shall provide the parties and witnesses with:</p> <ul> <li>The relevant written questions to be answered; and</li> <li>A deadline for the parties and witnesses to submit written responses to the questions and any appropriate follow-up questions or comments by the parties.</li> </ul> <p>The exchange of questions and responses by the parties and witnesses shall be concluded within a ten (10) calendar day period.</p> <ol> <li>Decision Making Process and Determination Requirements</li> </ol> <p>Following its review of the evidence submitted by the investigator, the Decision-Maker shall issue a written determination of responsibility.

The Appellate Decision-Maker shall have had no prior involvement in the process, including any dismissal appeal that may have been heard earlier in the process.</p> <p>The request for appeal shall be forwarded to the Appellate Decision-Maker for consideration to determine whether the request meets the grounds for appeal. This review is not a review of the merits of the appeal, but solely a determination as to whether the request meets the grounds and is filed in a timely manner.</p> <p>Appeals shall be limited to the following grounds:</p> <ul> <li>Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;</li> <li>New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter;</li> <li>The Coordinator, Investigator(s), or Decision-Maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the specific Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.</li> </ul> <p>Appeal procedure: Upon receipt of a valid appeal, the Coordinator shall:</p> <ul> <li>Notify the other party in writing that an appeal has been filed and implement the appeal procedure fairly and equally for both parties.</li> <li>Ensure the Appellate Decision-Maker is not:<ul> <li>The same person as the Decision-Maker that issued the written determination of responsibility;</li> <li>The person who issued the dismissal;</li> <li>The investigator; or</li> <li>The Coordinator.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Ensure the Appellate Decision-Maker has been trained in accordance with the requirements of this grievance procedure.</li> <li>Neither party is required to submit a written statement to the Appellate Decision-Maker.

The responding party shall be provided this opportunity regardless of whether the  appealing party submitted a written statement or not.  These should be submitted directly to the Appellate Decision-Maker.

Such materials may include:  Investigation Report, written questions and answers submitted to the Decision-Maker, Determination of Responsibility or Notice of Dismissal as well as any other material deemed to be relevant depending on the basis for the appeal.    The Appellate Decision-Maker may gather information beyond that contained in the investigation record, if necessary, to thoroughly review and consider the appeal.</li> <li>The Appellate Decision-Maker has no obligation or requirement to meet with the parties or other individuals when reviewing or considering an appeal.   Likewise, the Appellate Decision-Maker is not charged with \u2018re-investigating\u2019 the matter.</li> <li>Issue a written decision describing the result of the appeal and identifying the basis and rationale for the decision.</li> <li>Within thirty (30) school days, the Appellate Decision-Maker shall provide the written decision simultaneously to all parties.<ul> <li>The Appellate Decision-Maker may affirm, reverse, or dismiss the underlying decision.

It strictly prohibits the use of cell phones and personal electronic devices during instructional periods unless explicitly authorized and mandates that students not have cell phones or other personal electronic devices on their person to minimize distractions and cultivate an undistracted learning atmosphere.</p> <p>Scope: This regulation is applicable to all students within the West Ada School District.</p> <p>Implementation Guidelines: Cell phones and other personal electronic devices may not be kept on a student's person during instructional periods. Each school or classroom, as determined by the building administrator, must designate an area for students to deposit their electronic devices prior to the start of class, facilitating easy monitoring by teachers. This area may include student lockers, a basket, phone vault, or other conspicuous and clearly communicated \"Designated Storage Area\".</p> <p>Devices must be powered off before being placed in the Designated Storage Area. This practice promotes an environment conducive to academic engagement and reduces disruptions. Teachers may opt to designate a responsible student or establish a rotation system for collecting devices, ensuring a smooth and timely process while fostering a sense of accountability among students for their belongings.</p> <p>Smartwatches and other wearables are specifically exempted from the requirement to be placed in a \"Designated Storage Area\", but must be powered down during instructional time. Any use of or distractions created as a result of powered wearable devices will be subject to disciplinary action.</p> <p>Exceptions: Occasionally, teachers may permit the limited use of electronic devices strictly for educational purposes during class/instructional time, provided that clear guidelines are communicated to students. In cases of emergency necessitating immediate access to electronic devices, the teacher may address them on a case-by-case basis, exercising discretion. It's important to note that this Administrative Regulation does not pertain to school-issued tablets or laptops, nor to equipment specified in an individual student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP), English Learning Plan (ELP), 504 Plan, Health Services Plan, or any other health accommodations.</p> <p>Device Retrieval: Students may retrieve their electronic devices at the conclusion of the class/period, but only at the irection of the teacher. Teachers are responsible for conducting periodic checks to ensure that all devices are returned and properly accounted for.</p> <p>Enforcement: West Ada personnel are mandated to rigorously enforce this policy and Administrative Regulation within their classrooms. Repeated or egregious violations will be promptly escalated to the building\u2019s administration for further action using the discipline matrix.</p> <p>Loss/Damage: West Ada School District shall not be held liable for the theft or loss of electronic devices brought onto school premises.</p> <p>Communication with Parents and Guardians: It is imperative to inform parents and guardians about the electronic device policy and its accompanying Administrative Regulation through various channels such as newsletters, school websites, student handbooks, and other communication platforms. A designated point of contact at each school site must be readily available for parents or guardians to address any inquiries or concerns they may have regarding the policy.</p> <p>This Administrative Regulation is effective for the commencement of the 2024-2025 school year and supersedes any previous regulations regarding electronic device management, either District or school-wide.</p>"},{"location":"regulations/0500-Students/0503.20-AR-01/","title":"0503.20-AR-01 Curriculum Clubs","text":""},{"location":"regulations/0500-Students/0503.20-AR-01/#definitions","title":"Definitions:","text":"<ol> <li>\u201cAdvisor\u201d means the faculty member working with curriculum or non-curriculum clubs to ensure the Club and participant's compliance with applicable state and federal rules and regulations, District Policy, Procedure and Administrative Regulations.</li> <li>\u201cClosed forum\u201d means allowing only Curriculum Clubs.</li> <li>\u201cClub\u201d means any student organization that meets during non-instructional time.</li> <li>\"Club Sports and High-Risk Activities/Organizations\" refers to any activity whose subject or purposes are not encompassed within the definition of a curriculum club as outlined elsewhere in this document or addressed in Policy 503.80.

No opportunity approved by the District will involve the payment of any costs or fees by the student or family/legal guardian. The review committee will determine whether a proposed Extended Learning Opportunity qualifies for credit to be applied to the student transcript.

No adjustments of student transcripts shall be made other than when a student repeats the exact course.
